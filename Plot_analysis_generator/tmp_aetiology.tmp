ðŸ“„ Saved SBS1 page as SBS1.html
SBS1 Aetiology: An endogenous mutational process initiated by spontaneous or enzymatic deamination of 5-methylcytosine to thymine which generates G:T mismatches in double stranded DNA. Failure to detect and remove these mismatches prior to DNA replication results in fixation of the T substitution for C. 
***Comments: Signature SBS1 is clock-like in that the number of mutations in most cancers and normal cells correlates with the age of the individual. Rates of acquisition of Signature SBS1 mutations over time differ markedly between different cancer types and different normal cell types. These differences correlate with estimated rates of stem cell division in different tissues and Signature SBS1 may therefore be a cell division/mitotic clock.

SBS1 Second Aetiology: Spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine

SBS1 Associated Signatures: The activity of SBS1 is closely correlated with the activity of SBS5 within many types of cancer. However, between cancer types, mutation burdens of SBS1 and SBS5 do not clearly correlate consistent with them being due to different underlying processes.

SBS13 Aetiology: Attributed to activity of the AID/APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases on the basis of similarities in the sequence context of cytosine mutations caused by APOBEC enzymes in experimental systems. APOBEC3A is probably responsible for most mutations in human cancer, although APOBEC3B may also contribute (these differ in the sequence context two bases 5â€™ to the mutated cytosine, see 1536 mutation classification signature extraction). SBS13 mutations are likely generated by error prone polymerases (such as REV1) replicating across abasic sites generated by base excision repair removal of uracil. 
***Comments: SBS13 is usually found in the same samples as SBS2 . It has been proposed that activation of AID/APOBEC cytidine deaminases in cancer may be due to previous viral infection, retrotransposon jumping, or tissue inflammation. Currently, there is limited evidence to support these hypotheses. Germline polymorphisms involving APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B are associated with predisposition to breast and bladder cancer as well as with mutation burdens of SBS2 and SBS13. Mutations of similar patterns to SBS2 and SBS13 are commonly found in the phenomenon of local hypermutation present in some cancers, known as kataegis, implicating AID/APOBEC enzymes in this process as well.

SBS3 Aetiology: Defective homologous recombination-based DNA damage repair which manifests predominantly as small indels and genome rearrangements due to abnormal double strand break repair but also in the form of this base substitution signature. 
***Comments: SBS3 is strongly associated with germline and somatic BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations and BRCA1 promoter methylation in breast, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers.
