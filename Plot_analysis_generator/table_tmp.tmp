SBS1 Associated Signatures: The activity of SBS1 is closely correlated with the activity of SBS5 within many types of cancer. However, between cancer types, mutation burdens of SBS1 and SBS5 do not clearly correlate consistent with them being due to different underlying processes.
SBS10a Associated Signatures: SBS10a is associated with SBS10b and SBS28 and these signatures are commonly found in the same samples. DBS3 is also associated with SBS10a/ SBS10b .
SBS10b Associated Signatures: SBS10b is associated with SBS10a and SBS28 and these signatures are commonly found in the same samples. DBS3 is also associated with SBS10a /SBS10b.
SBS10d Associated Signatures: Associated with SBS10c and ID1 .
SBS13 Associated Signatures: SBS13 is closely associated with SBS2 . SBS13 is also associated with DBS11 , which is characterised predominantly by CC>TT doublet base substitutions as well as other CC>NN doublet base substitutions.
SBS17a Associated Signatures: SBS17a is associated with SBS17b and these signatures are commonly found in the same samples.
SBS17b Associated Signatures: SBS17b is associated with SBS17a and these signatures are commonly found in the same samples.
SBS2 Associated Signatures: SBS2 is closely associated with SBS13 . SBS2 is also associated with DBS11 , which is characterised predominantly by CC>TT doublet base substitutions as well as other CC>NN doublet base substitutions.
SBS26 Associated Signatures: SBS26 is associated ID1 and ID2 .
SBS28 Associated Signatures: SBS28 is found in most samples with SBS10a / SBS10b .
SBS3 Associated Signatures: Associated with ID6 , characterised by small deletions of >5bp with extended stretches of overlapping microhomology at breakpoint junctions. Also associated with signatures DBS13 , CN17 , and SV3 , as well as short tandem duplications (1-10kb), longer tandem duplications (>100kb), and deletions (1-10kb).
SBS44 Associated Signatures: SBS44 is associated with ID1 and ID2 .
SBS6 Associated Signatures: SBS6 is associated with large numbers of ID1 and ID2 mutations, which are characterised respectively by small (usually 1bp) insertions and deletions of T at mononucleotide T repeats.
SBS7b Associated Signatures: SBS7b is associated with SBS7a / SBS7c / SBS7d and these signatures are commonly found in the same samples. SBS7b is associated with DBS1 , which exhibits predominantly CC>TT mutations and also with ID13 , which is predominantly characterised by T deletions at TT dinucleotides.
SBS7c Associated Signatures: SBS7c is associated with SBS7a / SBS7b / SBS7d and these signatures are commonly found in the same samples.
SBS8 Associated Signatures: SBS8 is associated with CC>AA mutations.
SBS84 Associated Signatures: Associated with SBS85 .
SBS85 Associated Signatures: Associated with SBS84 .
SBS87 Associated Signatures: Found in combination with SBS86 in some relapsed ALL patients. Associated with increased CG>NN doublet base substitutions.
SBS89 Associated Signatures: SBS89 correlates with DBS8 , suggesting that they are due to the same underlying mutational process.
